## Face-Recognition-Attendance-Software
**IDEA** : A software that is able to identify the faces of students and is able to write thier names along with their roll Numbers in an excel sheets. There can be many faces in the view and the software should be able to recognize one face only once. The face that it has already recognized must be checked with a green sign indicating that the face has been recognized and its name has been registered in the ecxel sheet. Also the spreadsheet should be saved with the name of the batch and date and time.<br>

**OR** We can create the excel in the pretime and when the software is used to scan the faces of the students, it just check the column or write the Absent or Present in the file.<br>


We can use a pandas library to make a csv file with the names of the stdents already mentioned in the file. Whenever the scanning happpens a new columns(the name of the column should be the date and time) add to the file and save tht file.
